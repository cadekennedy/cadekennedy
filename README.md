## Personal Projects
Personal projects will be uploaded to this GitHub repository.
#### Machine Learning on Time Series Data 
I have provided two fairly similar .ipynb files that will showcase Machine Learning methods on stock market data through time-series analysis. "AI_Final_Project.ipynb" is a project that I built off of a previous stock market project. This project uses two different Machine Learning Methods: SVM Classifier and Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks. This project highlights the accuracy discrepancies of these two models on two varying forms of stocks. "Blue Chip" stocks and "Penny Stocks."
##### This project was aided by the following YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIUxPv5PJOY&ab_channel=ComputerScience

#### Web Scraping Project in C# using NET7.0
The provided code will be for local HTML file parsing due to security reasons for my client Urban Science. The "WebScraper" project is very easily transformed into an actual Web Scraper but is built for a specific website.
